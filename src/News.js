    <h2  >Watch Tesla Roadster Take On Ford F-650 Pickup Truck In Tug Of War Battle</h2>
    <p>
    A huge Ford F-650 pickup truck can easily beat a Tesla Roadster in a tug of war challenge, right? That's precisely what this video captures. A tug of war battle between two very unlikely opponents. it seems 
    about as lopsided as a tug of war contest could possibly be, but that's precisely what makes it so interesting.

    <h2  >2021 Ford F-150 Spied With A New Grille, Again</h2>
    <p>
    We are just 10 days away from the debut of the next-generation Ford F-150. It was officially confirmed that the new iteration of America’s best-selling vehicle for decades will be introduced on June 25, and today we can share a new spy video to ease the wait. 

It comes from The Fast Lane Truck channel on YouTube and shows a prototype testing on public roads in Colorado. It’s obviously wearing its production body but most of the panels are covered with a thin layer of camouflage foil. However, there’s 
no disguise covering some areas of the front fascia, letting us take a closer look at the radiator grille.</p>
